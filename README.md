# Super Store Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis of the "Super Store" using a dynamic and interactive dashboard built with Power BI. The dashboard provides key insights into sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Features

The dashboard is organized into several key sections to provide a holistic view of the business:

-   **Over-View:** A high-level summary of the store's performance, including total sales, total profit, total quantity sold, and average discount. The map visualization provides a geographical perspective on sales distribution across the United States.

-   **Monthly Trends:** This section visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) over time. Users can analyze monthly trends for total sales, total profit, total quantity sold, and transaction count to identify seasonal patterns and performance fluctuations.

-   **Category Performance:** An in-depth look at how different product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology) are performing. This view includes:
    -   A doughnut chart showing the percentage contribution of each category to total sales.
    -   A bar chart comparing the total profit generated by each category.
    -   A detailed table showing sales, profit, and discount by region and category.

-   **Customer Behaviour:** This section focuses on individual customer performance. It highlights key customers based on:
    -   Total quantity of products bought.
    -   Total profit generated.
    -   Total number of transactions.
    This analysis helps in identifying top-performing customers and understanding purchasing habits.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

Based on the data visualized in the dashboard, the following insights and recommendations can be derived:

### Insights

-   **Office Supplies Dominates:** The "Office Supplies" category is the top performer in terms of quantity sold and a significant contributor to total sales, as seen in the Category Performance view.
-   **Profitability Varies by Category:** While some categories drive sales volume, their profitability can differ. The "Technology" category, for example, is a strong profit driver. However, the "Furniture" category appears to be less profitable compared to its sales volume, with a notable negative profit in the Central region.
-   **Customer Loyalty:** The dashboard identifies top customers like "Anna Andreadi" and "Chuck Magee" who are major contributors to total profit and sales transactions.
-   **Seasonal Trends:** Sales, profit, and quantity sold tend to peak in the later months of the year (e.g., October-December), as shown in the Monthly Trends view, suggesting a seasonal uptick in business.
-   **Geographical Discrepancies:** The Over-View map and regional tables highlight that performance varies significantly across different states and regions.

### Recommendations

-   **Optimize Pricing for Furniture:** Investigate the negative profit for "Furniture" in the Central region. This could be due to high discounts or operational costs. A review of pricing and discount strategies for this category is recommended.
-   **Capitalize on Top Customers:** Develop targeted marketing and loyalty programs for top customers like Anna Andreadi and Chuck Magee to encourage repeat business and strengthen customer relationships.
-   **Leverage Seasonal Peaks:** Plan marketing campaigns and stock management around the end-of-year sales peak to maximize revenue and profit during the busy season.
-   **Expand on Office Supplies Success:** Analyze the success factors of the "Office Supplies" category and apply similar strategies to other underperforming categories to boost their sales and profitability.

## Technologies Used

-   **Power BI:** Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive reporting.

## How to Use
